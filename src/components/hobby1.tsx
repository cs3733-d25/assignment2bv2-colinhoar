            <p>
                In my free time I love to cook. Being a Vegetarian, I particularly enjoy the art of cooking.
                Not being limited to a small variety of options is awesome! My favorite dishes to cook consist of Panner
                Tikka Masala, Mac and Cheese, and Bean burritos.
                These are my go-to specials. On days that I have a little more time, I like to make pizza, and pastas. I
                also enjoy having my friends try the dishes and provide feedback on how it can be better. I
                have linked three of my favorite recipes for you to try! Happy Cooking!
